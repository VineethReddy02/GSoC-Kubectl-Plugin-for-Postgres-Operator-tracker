## Calender Week #1: 12th May to 19th May 

### Summary of work done: 
- Worked on k8s architecture by underdstanding different types of objects such as deployments, pods, replicaset, etc..
  I have documented my findings [here](https://github.com/VineethReddy02/Kubernetes-Notes).
- Thoroughly read postgres-operator documentation.
- I worked with glide dependency tool as i was not familar with it by creating sample project and vendoring dependencies into it.
- I ran postgres operator locally in minikube. It was more like an hello world with operator.

### What can be improved:
 - May be a call to understand the deliverables and to set expectations clear might help. If there are any standards 
   you are looking for during implementation, I can work on it.

### What went well:

- This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFlwQOPPkeg) has helped me in understanding Postgres operator
  and role of patroni in much better way.
  

### TODOs for next week

- Start working on plugin as the upcoming week implementation needs to be started.
- Understand the operator codebase by looking into it's implementation.
- Inspect the internals of postgres operator.
