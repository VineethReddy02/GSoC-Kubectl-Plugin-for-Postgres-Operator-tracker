## Calender Week #6: 17th June to 23rd June

### Summary of work done: 

 - Worked around different ways of implementing unit tests. But as it seems challenging with plugin usecases and with implementation.
 - Implemented ```kubectl pg scale [numberOfInstances] -c [CLUSTERNAME]```
 
### What can be improved:

- I need to find a solution for unit tests or re-write the kubectl pg commands with respect to unit tests.

### What went well:

- nil
  
### TODOs for next week

- Enhancemens in validations with provided comments from mentors.
- Better documentation for --help specific to each and every kubectl pg cmd.
- Connect to the master/replica pod shell-prompt/psql-prompt.
