# GSoC Kubectl Plugin for Postgres Operator tracker
Project tracker for my GSoC project - Kubectl Plugin - for The Postgres Operator.

## Project Abstract
The Postgres Operator is a project to create an open-sourced managed Postgres service for Kubernetes. The Postgres operator manages Postgres clusters on Kubernetes. kubectl plugins enable extending the Kubernetes command-line client kubectl with commands to manage custom resources. The task is to design and implement a plugin for the kubectl postgres command. My project aims to simplify and ease the usage of postgres clusters using the kubectl plugin. As the postgres operator is capable of many features having a kubectl plugin will ease in running the clusters and understanding the resources way better.
